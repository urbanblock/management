# My Management Readme


## What you can expect of me as your manager

A two weekly 1:1 (unless you specifically prefer a different cadence) where we’ll work on challenges, goals, and priorities to support you.

I will also share wider context and my own areas of focus or challenge. For managers, you can also expect regular “skip level” 1:1s where I’ll chat with your direct reports. 

I’ll transparently share context of my own goals, challenges and priorities - you should never wonder what on earth I do all day! (If you ever do, please nudge me!)

I’ll listen and hear your feedback, because it will help me improve. I know that I will make mistakes, and I'm going to make decisions that are wrong. If you come to me and you explain to me why something is wrong, I will listen, and I will fix it.

Clear, gentle, honest communication. I promise not to leave you guessing what I “really” think or expect you to read between the lines of what I’m saying. If it’s not clear, and you have a nagging feeling, let me know so I can fix it! It’s not intentional. I’ll also reply promptly to you, or let you know when you can expect a reply, if you reach out. 

Encouraging and modelling a healthy work-life balance and avoiding burnout.
